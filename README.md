# Tidal recruiting refactoring test

###### Please do not share this test or your answers on github or any other place where it can be found by a third party. 

##Intro
The code in this project is a isolated and very simplified version of our add-track-to-playlist business code.

##Assignments
1. Add necessary unit tests to the existing code to both see that the code works as expected, and to avoid breaking the code when refactoring
2. Refactor the existing code until you are satisfied with it
3. Implement the `removeTracks` method with appropriate unit tests

##Feel you are done or have questions?
When you have managed to make yourself believe that you are done, please send us a zip file with the code. If you have any question about the test do not hesitate to contact us.

Enjoy!
